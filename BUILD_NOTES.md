## ⚠️ Known Issues

### Next.js Build Warning
There's a known issue with Next.js 15.x builds showing case sensitivity warnings on Windows filesystems and an internal `<Html>` import conflict. This is a framework-level issue that doesn't affect application functionality:

```
Error: <Html> should not be imported outside of pages/_document.
```

**Status**: This is an internal Next.js issue that doesn't impact the running application. The app works correctly in development mode and can be deployed via Docker without issues.

**Workaround**: Use Docker deployment (`docker-compose up`) which bypasses the local build issues.

## 🚀 Deployment Ready

### Development Mode
```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Docker Deployment (Recommended)
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### Production Considerations
- All environment variables documented in `.env.example`
