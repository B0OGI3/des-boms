# Order Routing & Workstation Enhancement Plan
## DES-BOMS Specification Compliance Assessment

## ðŸŽ¯ **Current Status Assessment**

### âœ… **Already Implemented (Strong Foundation)**
- **Order-to-Batch Integration**: Complete with navigation modal
- **Workstation Management**: Basic operator interface with step confirmations
- **Routing Steps API**: Comprehensive filtering and workstation queue management
- **Real-time Updates**: 30-second refresh intervals
- **Step Confirmations**: Start/Complete/Flag functionality with photo uploads
- **Progress Tracking**: Order and batch completion monitoring
- **QR Code Integration**: Work travelers with batch linking

### ðŸ”§ **Gaps Identified for DES-BOMS Compliance**

## 1. **Enhanced Operator Authentication System**
**DES Spec**: "Log into assigned workstation"
**Current**: Basic operator name input
**Enhancement Needed**: Proper operator authentication with shift tracking

## 2. **Advanced Workstation Capacity Management**
**DES Spec**: "Real-time workstation status monitoring"
**Current**: Basic status tracking
**Enhancement Needed**: Capacity limits, efficiency tracking, machine utilization

## 3. **Enhanced Step Confirmation Workflow**
**DES Spec**: "Upload photos and flag issues with detailed logging"
**Current**: Basic photo upload
**Enhancement Needed**: Better issue tracking, detailed notes, approval workflows

## 4. **Manufacturing Floor Dashboard**
**DES Spec**: "Live status of all batches by stage"
**Current**: Individual workstation views
**Enhancement Needed**: Unified shop floor dashboard with all workstations

## 5. **Advanced Routing Templates Integration**
**DES Spec**: "Reusable routing workflows"
**Current**: Templates exist but limited integration
**Enhancement Needed**: Full template management and automatic routing assignment
