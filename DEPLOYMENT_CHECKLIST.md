sudo -u postgres createuser desboms_user -P

# Grant permissions
sudo -u postgres psql -c "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE desboms_prod TO desboms_user;"

# Run migrations
pnpm prisma migrate deploy
```

### 3. Application Deployment

```

### 4. Reverse Proxy Configuration (Nginx)
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com;
    return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name your-domain.com;
    
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/privkey.pem;
    
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
