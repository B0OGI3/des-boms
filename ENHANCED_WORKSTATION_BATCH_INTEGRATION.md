## 📦 **DES-BOMS Batch Integration Explained**

### **Complete Manufacturing Workflow**
```
Orders → Batches → Routing Steps → Workstations → Completion
   ↓         ↓           ↓             ↓           ↓
Customer  Production   Step-by-step  Physical    Quality
 Orders   Batches      Instructions  Execution   Control
```

### **How Workstations Interact with Batches**

#### 1. **Order Processing**
- Customer orders are received and processed
- Orders contain line items with parts and quantities
- Parts have routing templates defining manufacturing steps

#### 2. **Batch Creation**  
- Orders are converted into production batches
- Each batch represents a quantity of parts to manufacture
- Batches inherit routing requirements from part templates

#### 3. **Routing Step Assignment**
- Batch routing steps are assigned to specific workstations
- Each step defines what work needs to be done where
- Steps appear in workstation job queues when ready

#### 4. **Workstation Execution**
- Workers/operators use workstations page to see their job queue
- Start, complete, and document routing steps
- Add photos, notes, and flag issues as needed

#### 5. **Batch Progression**
- Completing routing steps moves batches through manufacturing
- Real-time tracking of batch status and completion
- Quality control and final inspection steps

## 🔄 **Complete Manufacturing Flow**

### **Step-by-Step Process**

1. **Orders Received** (Orders page)
   - Customer places order for parts
   - Order includes quantities and delivery requirements

2. **Batches Created** (Batches page)  
   - Production planner creates batches from orders
   - Batches sized based on production capacity and scheduling

3. **Routing Applied** (Automated)
   - Part routing templates automatically applied to batches
   - Routing steps assigned to appropriate workstations

4. **Workstation Execution** (Workstations page - THIS PAGE)
   - Operators see job queue for their workstation
   - Start, complete, and document each routing step
   - Add photos, notes, quality observations

5. **Batch Completion** (Automated)
   - When all routing steps complete, batch moves to QC
   - Quality control inspection and final approval
   - Finished goods ready for shipping
