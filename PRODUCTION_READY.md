# QuickBooks Customer Sync & Data Integrity

## Automatic Customer Cleanup on Orders Page

On every Orders page load, the system automatically synchronizes customers with QuickBooks Online by POSTing to `/api/quickbooks/sync-customers`. Any local customers not present in QuickBooks are deleted immediately. This ensures:

- The local customer database always matches QuickBooks.
- No orphaned or stale customer records remain.
- Data integrity is maintained for all order operations.

**Note:** There is no grace period for deletion; removals are immediate if a customer is not found in QuickBooks.
