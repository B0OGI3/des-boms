# Context Summary for Recent Edits (August 25, 2025)

## Overview

This commit includes significant improvements and bug fixes to the order management system, specifically around order editing, price calculation, and part selection. The following summarizes the context and rationale for the recent changes:

### Key Issues Addressed

- **Order price calculation and display**: Fixed to use `unitPrice` from the backend, ensuring accurate price display and updates.

- **Edit functionality**: The edit modal now allows full editing of line items, including price, part selection, and notes. All changes persist correctly.

- **Backend/Prisma errors**: Fixed issues where updates failed due to missing `partId` or `id` for line items. The frontend now sends all required identifiers.

- **Multiple line items for the same part**: Updates and deletions now work correctly by including the unique line item `id` in the payload.

- **Part number dropdown**: The part number in the edit modal is now a dropdown using a shared `PartSelector` component. UI freezes and focus issues have been resolved.

- **Table layout and usability**: The line items table in the edit modal is now wide, horizontally scrollable, and all fields are visible and editable.

- **Code quality**: Removed duplicate helper functions and resolved SonarQube warnings for maintainability.

### Files Changed

- `app/orders/components/EditOrderModal.tsx`: Major refactor for edit modal logic, part selection, and table layout.

- `app/orders/hooks/useOrderSearch.ts`: Ensures line item `id` is included in frontend types and update payloads.

- `app/orders/components/OrdersTable.tsx`: UI improvements for order table display.

- `app/api/orders/[id]/route.ts`: Backend update logic to handle line item identifiers and persist all changes correctly.

### Technical Stack

- Next.js/React frontend (Mantine UI, custom PartSelector)

- Prisma ORM backend (API routes, schema)

- TypeScript throughout

- SonarQube for code quality

### Status

All user-reported issues have been addressed. The codebase is now functionally correct, user-friendly, and free of major code quality warnings.
